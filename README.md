# Deep Flow Prediction: Reproduction on OpenFOAM v2606

A reproduction of **Thuerey et al., "Deep Learning Methods for Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes Simulations of Airfoil Flows"** (*AIAA Journal*, 2020) on current
software: OpenFOAM v2606, gmsh 4 and Docker on Windows. It is the first step
towards an extension to **inverted airfoils in ground effect** (F1 front wings).

## Progress

| Stage | Status |
|---|---|
| 1. Environment (Docker + OpenFOAM v2606 + gmsh + Python) | Done |
| 2. Port the data generation pipeline to OpenFOAM v2606 | Done |
| 3. First simulation and training sample | Done (about 95 s per sample on a laptop) |
| 4. Download the authors' precomputed dataset | Done (`data_6k`: 6,400 train / 90 test, SHA-512 verified) |
| 5. Train the U-Net and reproduce the paper's error numbers | First run done (CPU, 48 min). See [Results](#results) |
| 6. Compare my results with the paper | First comparison done. Next: repeat seeds and match the paper's training length |
| 7. Extension: inverted airfoil in ground effect | Planned |

### Log
- **2026-11-07**: Set up the Docker environment. Found and fixed four
  incompatibilities between the original OpenFOAM 5 setup and OpenFOAM v2606
  (see below). Generated and plotted the first training sample.
- **2026-11-07**: Downloaded the authors' `data_6k` dataset
  ([TUM data service](https://dataserv.ub.tum.de/index.php/s/m1470791),
  1.3 GB): 6,400 training and 90 test samples. Checksum verified. The training
  code expects it in `Deep-Flow-Prediction/data/train` and `data/test`.
- **2026-11-07**: First training run on CPU (Ryzen 7 7730U, PyTorch 2.15 CPU).
  U-Net with `expo = 5` (2.33M parameters) trained for 10k iterations in 48 min.
  Test error on 90 unseen airfoils: 3.17% overall, 2.61% velocity, 16.6%
  pressure, close to the paper (see Results).

## What the model learns

Each training sample is a 6 × 128 × 128 array covering a 2 × 2 chord-length
region around the airfoil:

| Channel | Meaning | Role |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Freestream velocity X | Input |
| 1 | Freestream velocity Y | Input |
| 2 | Airfoil mask (1 = inside the airfoil) | Input |
| 3 | Pressure *p* | Target |
| 4 | Velocity *Ux* | Target |
| 5 | Velocity *Uy* | Target |

The network, a U-Net, takes the airfoil shape and inflow conditions and
predicts the full RANS flow field in milliseconds. The CFD simulation takes
about 95 s.

*First sample generated with this setup: airfoil `s4061` at about 22° to the
flow, |U| = 30 m/s. The flow separates under the airfoil, visible as reversed
flow (blue in Ux) and a strong low-pressure region.*

## Results

### Run 1: U-Net, `expo = 5`, `data_6k`, CPU

| Setting | This run | Paper (best model, Sec. 4) |
|---|---|---|
| Trainable parameters | 2.33M | 30.9M |
| Training samples | 6,000 (+400 validation) | 12,800 |
| Training iterations | 10,000 (repo default) | 80,000 |
| Hardware / time | Laptop CPU, 48 min | GPU |

Relative error on the **90 unseen test airfoils**
(`runTestCpu.py`, mean of |prediction − CFD| / |CFD|):

| Quantity | This run | Paper, largest model, 12.8k samples |
|---|---|---|
| Velocity | **2.61%** | 2.15% (Ux), 2.6% (Uy) |
| Pressure | **16.6%** | 14.76% |
| Combined | **3.17%** | 2.6% |

For reference, the paper's *smallest* model (123k parameters) reached 3.3% with
12.8k samples.

**Interpretation:** the first run lands where the paper's scaling study says it
should. It is between the paper's smallest and largest models, while using half
the data, an eighth of the iterations, and a laptop CPU. Pressure has a much
higher relative error than velocity, as in the paper: pressure values are often
small, so small absolute errors become large relative errors.

**Caveats:** this is a single training run. The paper averages five runs with
different random seeds. The next step is to repeat this run with several seeds
and to train for longer.

*Training and validation L1 loss per epoch. Both fall steadily and end close
together (0.0060 / 0.0053), so the model is not overfitting.*

## Changes needed for OpenFOAM v2606

The original code targets OpenFOAM 5 (openfoam.org). Running it on OpenFOAM
v2606 (openfoam.com) with gmsh 4 required these fixes, collected in
[`patches/openfoam-v2606.patch`](patches/openfoam-v2606.patch):

| # | Problem | Error seen | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | gmsh 4 writes the MSH 4 mesh format by default | mesh conversion fails | add `-format msh2` to the gmsh call in `dataGen.py` |
| 2 | v2606's `freestreamPressure` requires an explicit far-field value | `Required entry 'freestreamValue' missing in dictionary "0/p/boundaryField/inlet"` | add `freestreamValue uniform 0;` to the four far-field patches in `0/p` |
| 3 | v2606 writes sampled fields to one file, not one per field | `cloud_p.xy not found` | read `cloud_p_U.xy` |
| 4 | the combined file's columns are `x y z p Ux Uy Uz` | (wrong values, no error) | read Ux and Uy from columns 4 and 5 instead of 3 and 4 |

Windows-specific issues:
- Clone with `core.autocrlf=false`. Otherwise the shell scripts get Windows
  line endings and fail inside Linux.
- If pasted commands show up as `[200~...`, run
  `bind 'set enable-bracketed-paste off'` inside the container.

## How to run it

**Requirements:** Docker Desktop. No local OpenFOAM install is needed.

```powershell
# 1. Build the image: OpenFOAM v2606 + gmsh + Python
docker build -t openfoam-ml .

# 2. Get the original code with Linux line endings, then apply the v2606 fixes
git clone --config core.autocrlf=false https://github.com/thunil/Deep-Flow-Prediction.git
cd Deep-Flow-Prediction
git apply ../patches/openfoam-v2606.patch
cd ..

# 3. Start the container with this folder shared as /work
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/work openfoam-ml
```

Inside the container:
```bash
cd /work/Deep-Flow-Prediction/data
bash download_airfoils.sh        # about 1,500 training and 30 test airfoils (UIUC database)
python3 dataGen.py               # number of simulations set by `samples` in dataGen.py
python3 /work/scripts/view_sample.py train/<file>.npz /work/results/sample.png
```
